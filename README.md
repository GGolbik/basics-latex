# Build

The LaTeX document can be build with the provided build scripts `docker.sh`, `build.sh` or with [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).

## Docker

It's recommended to use the `docker.sh` script instead of the `build.sh` script to keep your build environment clean.

## Shell

You can build the document in your local build environment with the `build.sh` script but you must install the dependencies as you can see in the `Dockerfile`.

## Overleaf

Copy the `src` directory to your [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) project.
